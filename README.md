# News Explorer
> news-explorer-frontend

"News Explorer" is a full-stack application where users could search for news articles by keyword and save them while logged in. This is my final project of the Web Development course by Practicum by Yandex. 

The repo for its backend is located [here](https://github.com/tatianakomar/news-explorer-api).
 
## Features

- Responsive and reusable React components
- The public API service [news API]('https://newsapi.org') to search for news articles by keywords
- The API service for user authentication and saving articles using Express.js and MongoDB

## Run locally

`npm run start` — to launch the server.

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature.
